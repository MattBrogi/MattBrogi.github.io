   <h3>Biography</h3>
   <p>I was born in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grosseto" target="_blank">Grosseto</a>, 
   a small Italian town in Southern Tuscany, close to the coastline of the Tyrrhenian Sea. 
   Long summers and beautiful dark skies characterised my adolescence and certainly contributed to stimulate my innate interests in the universe.</p>
   <p>After graduating from a science-oriented high school I moved to 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa" target="_blank">Pisa</a>, where I attended 
   University and I got a degree in Astrophysics focussing on numerical N-body integration of planetary orbits. For my final project, I 
   computed the location of the habitable zones in the exoplanetary systems and studied their 
   dynamical stability.</p>
   <p>Intrigued by the rapidly-growing field of exoplanets and by the quest for an Earth 
   analog, I decided to orient my postgraduate research towards exoplanets and their atmospheres. 
   I started as a PhD student at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy" target="_blank">Leiden Observatory</a> in 
   2010 and joined the group of Ignas Snellen. 
   While sharpening my observational skills at various telescope facilities, I became a key player in perfectioning a novel technique for studying the atmospheres of exoplanets at high spectral resolution, obtaining the first successful results after more than a decade of inconclusive attempts by other teams. These milestones led to the award of a <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program" target="_blank">NASA Hubble Fellowship</a>, which I held at the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/aps/" target="_blank">University of Colorado Boulder</a> between 2014 and 2017.</p>
   <p> In the Fall of 2017 I joined the <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/physics/research/astro/" target="_blank">Astronomy and Astrophysics</a> group of the University of Warwick as an Assistant Professor first, and I became Associate Professor in 2022. At the end of 2022 I moved to the <a href="https://www.physics.unito.it/do/home.pl" target="_blank">University of Turin</a> as an Associate Professor. My current research is aimed at pushing the limits of high-dispersion observations towards smaller and cooler planets, and defining analysis technique to combine them with space-based low-resolution observations. This will allow us in the near future to become sensitive to the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting the habitable zones of small stars.</p>
