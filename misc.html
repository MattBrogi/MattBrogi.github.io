    <h3>Playing music</h3>
    Music has always been the most effective way to unleash the irrational part of my 
    personality, and to express those artistic and creative needs that science cannot really 
    fulfill.<br/>
    I developed my best skills while playing piano and keyboards. I like to experiment with 
    synthesizers and try to emulate the sound of progressive rock bands of the 1970s. Hammond 
    organs, minimoogs, and mellotrons define the type of music I like the most. <br/>I owe 
    most of my knowledge to my uncle, who was a professional musician. Thanks to him I can 
    also play some guitars, bass guitars, and drums. I learned sequencing, multitrack 
    recording, and mixing from sound checks during my live shows, and from visits to small 
    recording studios. With my small personal studio I have composed, arranged and recorded 
    two solo albums: <i>Sogno ad occhi aperti (Daydream)</i> in 2007 and <i>Runaway Effects</i> 
    in 2010.<br/>
    I got most of my inspiration from the sound of <i>Pink Floyd</i>. Between 2005 and 2009 
    I joined a tribute project called <i>Division Bell</i>, culminated with a last reunion 
    concert in Pisa, Italy, in March 2013. Former guitarist Edo Scordo is now touring with 
    the world-acclaimed tribute band <a href="http://www.britfloyd.com" target="_blank">
    Brit Floyd</a>.
    <h3>Watching the sky</h3>
    Before starting to study astronomy, I spent years observing the sky with a small Newtonian telescope from the countryside of my hometown in Tuscany, one of the few really dark skies left in Italy. The Milky Way sculpting the sky was one of the most fascinating views for me as a child. Retrospectively, I am sure it contributed to feed my interest for the universe and its mysteries. <span class="bw">&nbsp<script language="Javascript" src="counter/counter.php?page=totcount"><!--//--></script></span>
